# Week 8 Weekend Lab

Working as a team or alonem, choose one of the following assignments and complete
it:

* [Question Box (standard web app)](question_box.md)
* [ATUS API](atus_api.md)

Your choice is up to you and what you want to practice. Each of these
assignments has parts that you do not yet know how to do and you will need
to do research to solve them.

## Objectives

These assignments are meant to test your whole knowledge of Django, either
as a tool to build web applications or APIs. In addition, it is a test of
working in a team, much like you will be for the final project.

## Requirements

* You should complete at least the normal mode for your assignment.
* Your assignment should be deployed to Heroku. Put the URL where it is
deployed in your pull request.
